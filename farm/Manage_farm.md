# Managing a farm
Your farm fields would be nested under a farm. That's why the first thing you need to do when starting farmerJoe is to create a farm.

## Create a new farm

If you are just starting with farmerJoe you can create a new company either by taping on the plus sign on the top right corner or by taping on the create button.

On the next screen fill your farm's name and address and hit save. Afterwards you will be redirected back to the farms screen and it will look similar to this:
