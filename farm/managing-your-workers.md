# Managing your workers

Unless you are working alone, chances are that you'll employ workers on your farm \(no matter if they are family members, or external workers\). You'll have the most benefit from farmerJoe if you add those workers to your farm. Once added those workers will be able to comment on the fields just like you do. This way you'll always know what was done on a field and will have a better overview of what has been done and what needs to be done in the farm.

## Worker permissions

In farmerJoe we have 3 groups of users: **admins**, **workers** & **advisors**.

### Admins

When you create a farm - you are automatically assigned the admin role. An admin is able to create new fields, plant crops, add wait times, fertilizer etc. The admin basically can do everything & see everything! He can delete comments/activities from other users - even from other admins. Admins are also able to invite other users to your farm.

### Workers

The workers on a farm have restricted permissions.

You can restrict the following items for a worker:

* Field access
* Crop access
* Comment access
* Wait time
* Fertilizer

You can select whether a worker should see all fields in the farm or just the fields that you assign to him. You are also able to specify whether a worker should see the activities only for the current crop or also old crops. You can further restrict what he see by selecting whether he should see only his notes or the notes of everyone else.

The idea behind this system is that if you have workers that are employed by you the whole year, then you trust them and you want that they have the complete overview of what is going on. On the other hand if you have seasonal workers - they don't need to know what you've sprayed, what issues you had etc. For them you can just specify that they should see where the fields are and allow them to comment on the field once they've complitted a task.

### Advisors

The advisor has basically the same rights as a worker above. An advisor would generally come to your farm when you have a problem - plant is not growing, you don't know what to spray etc. In such cases you can invite an advisor to your farm assign a field for him and he can see what you've done and help you with a correct solution/advise on what to do next.

## Managing users

### Adding new employees to the farm

_**You need to be an admin in the farm in order to create new users.**_ To create a new user open your farm, then on the bottom of the screen click on Users. Now on top right you have a plus sign. Click on it. You'll be presented with a form for inputing an name and email. Make sure that you input a correct email address. The worker will be able to join your farm only if his registration in farmerjoe matches this address.

To help you with inputing this information there is the option to search a worker in your Phonebook. If you have the contact information stored in your phone book just click the "Search in Phonebook" button and find the worker there. Click on it and the name and email field will be automatically filled with the information from the PhoneBook.

Now assign the permissions for this worker and click on Save.

The worker will be sent an invitation and once he logs into farmerJoe he would be able to accept this invitation.
